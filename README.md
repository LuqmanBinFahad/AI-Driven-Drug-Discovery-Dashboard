# AI-Driven Drug Discovery Dashboard ðŸ§ ðŸ’Š

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of how Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the various phases of drug discovery and development. It's designed particularly for professionals with a background in Pharmacy (PharmD) and related fields, aiming to bridge traditional pharmaceutical knowledge with the rapidly evolving landscape of AI in research and development.

## Features

*   **Key Statistics:** At-a-glance comparison of traditional drug discovery metrics versus AI-driven improvements in cost, time, and success rates.
*   **Interactive Sections:** Collapsible sections detailing each phase of drug discovery, contrasting traditional approaches with AI-powered innovations.
*   **Detailed AI Tools:** Mentions specific AI models and platforms (e.g., `AlphaFold`, `PandaOmics`, `DeepDock`, `REINVENT`, `ADMETlab`, `Deep6 AI`) and their applications in each phase.
*   **Clear Explanations:** Provides context for both traditional methods and AI advancements, making complex topics accessible.
*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern user interface.

## Drug Discovery Phases Covered

1.  **Target Discovery & Validation:** How AI integrates multi-omics data and predicts protein structures to identify novel drug targets.
2.  **Hit Identification & Lead Optimization:** AI's role in virtual screening, enhanced molecular docking, and generative molecule design for faster and more effective compound identification.
3.  **Preclinical Studies (ADMET):** Leveraging AI-driven QSAR models and molecular dynamics simulations to predict Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity properties early.
4.  **Clinical Trials & Post-Market Surveillance:** Optimizing clinical trial design, enhancing pharmacovigilance, and enabling drug repurposing with AI.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
*   JavaScript (for interactive collapsible sections)
